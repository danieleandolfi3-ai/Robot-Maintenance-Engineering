# Robot-Maintenance-Engineering

This repository contains a project that explores possible application of machine learning to PHM. The use case is a logistics robot for pick and place tasks in Ecole Centrale Supelec in Paris.

The idea is try to develop an algorithm able to detect failures based on phisical features of 6 motors of the robot. Data are collected in the lab and not available while code is proposed in this repository. The main results obtained from this project is that complex algorithms not always work better especialy in maintance where datasets are extremmly unbalanced since failures are significantly less than not failures. Our group won the data challenge on Kaggle about the project. 

A picture of the robot is also proposed in the repository.
